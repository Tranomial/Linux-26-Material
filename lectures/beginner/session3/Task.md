# **Archive & Compression Task**

---

## Task 3 Submission Guidelines

1. Create a directory named task-3.

2. Inside the `task-3` directory, create a file named `solution.txt`.

3. In `solution.txt`, write the commands used to solve each step. **Do not include the output of the command.**

4. Paste only the command used, don't paste the prompt alongside it

    
    [osc@osc ~]$ touch newFile # This **is not accepted**

    touch newFile # This is correct
    

5. Don't paste output of commands .

**Note:** 

✔️ Follow the steps in order — do NOT skip

✔️ Use your **own name** in the folder (`habiba_project`)

✔️ Ask if something is unclear before the deadline

### **1️⃣ Create the Project Structure**

- Create a directory named after you (yourname_project) and inside it build the following structure:

```
yourname_project/
├── docs/
│   ├── report.txt
│   └── notes.txt
├── images/
│   ├── img1.png
│   └── img2.png
└── secret.txt
```

### **2️⃣ Create a tar Archive**

- Create a **tar archive** containing the entire folder.

- Then list the contents of the archive.

---

### **3️⃣ Compress the Archive Using gzip and bzip2**

* Compress the tar file using **gzip**
* Compress a tar file using **bzip2**
* Compare the file sizes

---

### **4️⃣ Create a ZIP Archive**

* Create a **zip archive** for the entire project folder
* List the content of the zip file

---

### **5️⃣ Extract All Archives**

Extract:
